welcome!

my name is tucker, i am a product engineer based out of NYC 🗽

i've been writing software professionally for over 6 years. i currently build products at [iggy](https://askiggy.com), a geospatial analysis startup that provides insights for your place data. 🌎🌍🌏

in the past, i've written code that powers content moderation tools, highly-available ad-delivery systems, MLS search engines, CVE reporting applications, and hybrid e-commerce stores.

my work focuses mainly on backend web application development, but i have hobbyist research interest in computer vision and AI.

outside of family and work, i enjoy developing my interests:
  * cooking (my current go-to dishes are carbonara and [pizza from scratch](https://twitter.com/tttuckerrr/status/1450540042817048579?s=20) 🍕)
  * filmmaking ([my camara-roll music video project](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0hRSCoTpUxopM7l9RDMZ3w/videos))
  * trail running ⛰️🏃‍♂️⛰️
  * underground electronic music  ([some of my favorite tunes 💃💃💃](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2m5v9AuwYBKqj3ch1QbtVC?si=bc343e28479e440c))

eventually, i hope this will grow into my own [digital garden](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up) 💐🌷🌻
