welcome!

i'm tucker, a software engineer based out of Virginia, USA 🇺🇸

i currently build moderation tools for a 🦄  startup.

my work focuses mainly on backend web application development, but i have "hobbiest" research interest in computer vision, digital signal processing, and software defined radio.

in the past, i've written code that powers highly-available ad-delivery systems, search indexes for MLS data, CVE reporting applications, and hybrid e-commerce stores.

outside of family and work, i try utilize free time to cultivate my interests:
  * cooking (my current go-to dishes are carbonara and [pizza](https://twitter.com/tttuckerrr/status/1450540042817048579?s=20) 🍕)
  * exploring (trail running, orienteering, camping)
  * underground electronic music  ([some of my favorite tunes 💃💃💃](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2m5v9AuwYBKqj3ch1QbtVC?si=bc343e28479e440c))
  * tinkering/fixing things (a [Corne keyboard](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) kit build at the moment)
  * reading (currently, 100 years of solitude)
  * filmmaking ([my camara-roll music video project](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0hRSCoTpUxopM7l9RDMZ3w/videos))

i'm building this space to develop and share my thoughts on the above
