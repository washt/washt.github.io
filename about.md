Salutations! I'm Tucker, a student at [ODU](http://www.cs.odu.edu/) majoring in Computer Science. I currently work with robots and cameras, doing [undergraduate research](http://www.eng.odu.edu/visionlab/people.php#ug_0) at the [Virginia Institute for Image and Vision Analysis](http://www.eng.odu.edu/visionlab/). I also hack on python while building business systems at [The Franklin Johnston Group](http://thefranklinjohnstongroup.com/profile/). Hackathons are a fun pastime for me, and I managed to [place](http://www.cs.odu.edu/show_news.shtml?231) at my most recent one. In my spare time, I enjoy cooking,finding new music, and word jousting.
