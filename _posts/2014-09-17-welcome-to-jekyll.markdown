Finally got around to rebuilding my page after a doomed affair with wordpress. I'll give blogging a go again, perhaps it'll stick now that I can update with git every morning...but only if I feel I have something worth blogging about. Some of my projects will go up over the next few weeks. But for now, I'll give you my latest trick:
 
{% highlight Java %}
//Amazing feats here, people.
public static void main(String[] args) {
  System.out.println("Is this thing on?");
}
{% endhighlight %}

....and thats all I have for you today.
