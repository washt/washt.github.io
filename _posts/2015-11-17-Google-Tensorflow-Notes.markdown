### This is a collection of note I made in a Jupyter notebook while going over [Deep-MNIST](http://tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist/pros/index.md) tutorial for Google's Tensorflow. Some comments are ripped directly off the page, while others are attempts to simply concepts or explicitly explain what may be implied.
